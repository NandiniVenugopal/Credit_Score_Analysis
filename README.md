Risk management plays a crucial role in the banking industry. In terms of preventing losses and profitability, loan granting is one of the aspects that financial institutions focus on. It is necessary to distinguish the loan defaulters, thereby avoiding the risk of bad loans. The report aims to provide a guideline for banking institutions to evaluate their customers' credit scores. Two different techniques, including logistic regression and random forest, are utilized, which allow the banking industry to identify good or bad customers accurately. The proposed work demonstrates a result which is related to the given Brazilian customers' dataset. In conclusion, among these two machine learning approaches, random forest found to be the most effective one which is suitable for imbalanced datasets. According to the F1-score, recall value and the confusion matrix of the grouped result, the adjusting threshold method is proven to perform better. The analysis report offers preventive methods and practical insights that benefit the financial industry in managing credit risk when making decisions.
Addressing the imperative of credit risk modeling, the study has undertaken the task of developing a predictive model for a banking institution to evaluate the probability of customer default. Recognizing the profound implications of credit risk on a bank's capital and financial stability, our objective is to refine the credit scoring processâ€”a pivotal instrument for informed decision-making regarding credit approval or denial. The foundational dataset for our analysis comprises synthetic data pertaining to credit card customers over a one-year period. Credit scoring, as a nuanced practice, manifests in varying approaches across banks, characterized by distinct models, features, and approval thresholds. Our mandate is to navigate this intricate landscape and construct a predictive model, drawing upon methodologies and techniques acquired through our academic curriculum.
This projectis poised to serve as a comprehensive guide for the bank, presenting and justifying the proposed model and its resultant findings. Through a meticulous analysis of the dataset, our aim is to offer insights that transcend mere predictive accuracy. The focal point lies in furnishing actionable recommendations to optimize the credit scoring process. Acknowledging the bank as the end-user, the report aligns with their vested interests, emphasizing considerations such as risk aversion, the current
customer portfolio, and the strategic implications inherent in the proposed model. Commencing with an exploration of the predictive model's robustness, this study not only highlights its efficacy but also elucidates the ensuing business implications. Recommendations are tailored to enhance the bank's credit evaluation procedures, potentially advocating adjustments in lending strategies based on customer features. By assuming the perspective of the bank, our report aspires to meet not only technical standards but also to provide strategic counsel for augmenting the overall credit risk management process.
This study oversees the methods used to predict the credit scores of customers of a financial institution to recognize loan defaulters. Credit scoring helps organizations to have an aligned environment to estimate the risks associated with defaulting. It is said that if a bank undergoes the
practice of scoring their customers, they would never use other judgemental-based systems (Lewis, 1992). This research study reveals that the predictive model, Random Forest, is best suitable for this particular case because of the particular variations and distribution of the customers' dataset. This analysis plays a crucial role in the banking sector for lenders or investors to form important customer-based decisions as well as to prevent banks from huge financial losses. Out of all the models
presented above which includes decision trees and random forest predicted the value with the best accuracy.
The analysis established would help the stakeholders in improving their financial conditions by utilizing these results wisely. Even with the persisting limitations like the unavailability of some crucial data, errors and missing values, this study remains a basic framework for further modifications and future research by comparing the results of random forest values with different prediction models like GBM or genetic algorithms.
